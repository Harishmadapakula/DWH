## 📌 About the Project
This project focuses on **Data Warehousing (DWH)** concepts, covering the design, implementation, and optimization of data warehouse systems. The aim is to create a structured and efficient data warehouse for analytical processing.

## 🚀 Features
- **Data Warehouse Design**: Dimensional modeling (Star and Snowflake schemas)
- **ETL Pipelines**: Data extraction, transformation, and loading using SQL
- **SQL Queries for Analytics**: Aggregate functions, joins, and indexing for performance
- **Visualization Reports**: Insights from data using BI tools
- **Optimization Strategies**: Indexing, partitioning, and query performance tuning

## 📌 Real-World Use Cases
- **Retail Industry**: Sales trend analysis, customer segmentation
- **Healthcare**: Patient records management, predictive analytics
- **Finance**: Fraud detection, risk assessment models
- **E-commerce**: Personalized recommendations, demand forecasting

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Databases:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server
- **ETL Tools:** Apache NiFi, Talend, Python (Pandas, SQLAlchemy)
- **Visualization:** Power BI, Tableau
- **Cloud Integration:** AWS Redshift, Google BigQuery

## 📈 Performance Considerations
- **Indexing Strategies**: Use composite and covering indexes for faster queries.
- **Partitioning Large Tables**: Improves performance by reducing the scanned dataset size.
- **Query Optimization**: Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE to identify bottlenecks.
- **Materialized Views**: Store precomputed query results for faster retrieval.
- **Compression & Storage Optimization**: Use columnar storage formats (e.g., Parquet) for efficiency.

## 📌 Hands-On Example
Here’s a real-world example query using a sales dataset:
```sql
SELECT customer_id, SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales
FROM fact_sales
WHERE transaction_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-03-31'
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY total_sales DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
*This query retrieves the top 10 customers with the highest sales in Q1 2024.*

## 📌 Dataset Source
The dataset used in this project is sourced from:
- [Kaggle - Retail Sales Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- Custom synthetic datasets generated for testing

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting
- **Missing Dependencies?** Run the following command to install required packages:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- **Database Connection Issues?** Ensure that the database server is running and update the connection parameters in `config.py`.
- **Slow Query Performance?** Use indexing strategies and query optimization techniques.

## 📌 How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Harishmadapakula/DWH.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd DWH
   ```
3. Set up the database:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE data_warehouse;
   ```
4. Run the ETL scripts:
   ```bash
   python scripts/etl_pipeline.py
   ```
5. Execute queries for data analysis:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM fact_sales WHERE sales_amount > 1000;
   ```
